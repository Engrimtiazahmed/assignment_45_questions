Question #44; Sandwiches:
          Write a function that accepts a array of items a person wants on a sandwich. The function should have
          one parameter that collects as many items as the function call provides, and it should print a summary
          of the sandwich that is being ordered. Call the function three times, using a different number of
          arguments each time.
