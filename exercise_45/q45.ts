         Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a
         manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the 
         function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional
         feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
