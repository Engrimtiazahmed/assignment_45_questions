//Question 22:Intentional Error:
//  If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one of your programs yet, try to make
//  one happen. Change an index in one of your programs to produce an index error. Make
//   sure you correct the error before closing the program.
let foodMenu = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'];
console.log(foodMenu[7]); //Intentional Error:Arrays are zero-indexed, so index 4 is out of Array.
console.log(foodMenu[5]); // Error corrected by accessing the valid index.
